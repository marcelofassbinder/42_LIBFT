# 42_LIBFT ðŸ“š
My very first own library and the first 42 Common Core project!

# About 
Libft aims at creating a custom C library with essential functions that will be invaluable for future projects in the 42 Common Core curriculum. This library is designed to provide you with a solid foundation of fundamental functions commonly used in C language. In the journey of becoming a proficient C programmer, understanding the inner workings of basic functions is crucial. Libft not only serves as a compilation of essential functions but also offers you the opportunity to recreate these functions from scratch. This process enhanced my understanding of data structures, algorithmic thinking, and the intricacies of C programming.

# Functions 
Libft includes a variety of functions, each one crafted to provide a solid understanding of their underlying principles. Some of the functions you will find include:
- **String Manipulation**: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcat`, etc.
- **Character Functions**: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, etc.
- **Memory Functions**: `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memset`, `ft_memmove`, etc.
- **Printing Functions**: `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`, etc.
- **Comparison Functions**: `ft_memcmp`, `ft_strcmp`, `ft_strncmp`.
- **Data Conversion Functions**: `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`.
- **List Manipulation Functions (Bonus)**: `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstsize`, etc.
